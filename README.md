2. extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## Steps to Complete the Project
1. Download and get the datasets UCI HAR Dataset.
2. Clean datasets and generate the required tidy data set "tidy_data_set.txt" by the R code in run_analysis.R
3. Describe related variables by CodeBook.md
